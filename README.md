# replit-text-games
terminal text games transferred over from replit

download `manager.sh` to manage all games files

download with `manager.sh -d <game-name>` ex. `manager.sh -d sk-uv`  
this will create a new directory called `sk-uv` and install all the necessary files in there  
`manager.sh -t <game-name>` will give info on how to run the game  
the files assume you're already in the game directory


keep all the game directories and `manager.sh` all at the same level wherever you put them  
to update, just run `manager.sh -u <game-name>` ex. `manager.sh -u sk-uv`  
to delete, run `manager.sh -r <game-name>` ex. `manager.sh -r sk-uv` 


to update `manager.sh`, run `manager.sh -s`
