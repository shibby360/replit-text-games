terminal text games transferred over from replit

download `manager.sh` to manage all games files

download with `manager.sh -d <game-name>` ex. `manager.sh -d sk-uv`  
this will create a new directory called `sk-uv` and install all the necessary files in there  
just `cd` to the directory, enable any permissions, and then run `main.py` or whatever the main file is to start playing


keep all the game directories and `manager.sh` all at the same level wherever you put them  
to update, just run `manager.sh -u <game-name>` ex. `manager.sh -u sk-uv`
