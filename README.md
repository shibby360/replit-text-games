terminal text games transferred over from replit

download `downloader.sh` and use that to download the games  
download `updater.sh` as well, keep them both in the same directory


download with `downloader.sh <game-name>` ex. `downloader.sh sk-uv`  
this will create a new directory called `sk-uv` and install all the necessary files in there  
just `cd` to the directory, enable any permissions, and then run `main.py` or whatever the main file is to start playing


keep all the game directories, `downloader.sh`, and `updater.sh` all at the same level wherever you put them  
to update, just run `updater.sh <game-name>` ex. `updater.sh sk-uv`
